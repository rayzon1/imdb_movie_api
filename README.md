# Omdb Review App
For this one page App I wanted to practice usage of fetch and working with API's

# Description
The main page shows a minimilistic design with a search bar to input either keywords
or the titles of movies. After clicking the submit button the page will populate with
the review posters and titles. When the user hovers over the poster an overlay will 
show providing the reviews generated by the API information.

After the search the page generates the pagination links on the bottom which when 
clicked will cycle through the pages of results. Clicking on a movie poster will 
take the user to the imdb page of the movie.
